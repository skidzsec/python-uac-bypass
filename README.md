# Python UAC Bypass
A fully working UAC bypass written in python


This project heavily relies on https://github.com/skidzsec/powershell-uac-bypass. And the FileBin DLL payload can be made from there.\
The filebin url will also be expired, so you will have to create your own payload but I will place it in releases.
